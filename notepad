This strategy is designed to optimize resource consumption during the Proof of Concept (POC) phase. By utilizing a simple repository for initial testing, we minimize the number of tokens consumed by the LLM, leading to faster processing times and enabling more frequent iterations and debugging cycles. This allows for rapid prototyping and exploration of the tool's capabilities within a controlled environment. Once the POC phase is complete, we will transition to the more complex repository to thoroughly evaluate the tool's performance and accuracy in handling real-world codebases.
