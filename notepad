Code Analyzer Documentation
Project Title: Code Analyzer with LLM-Powered Documentation Generation
1. Project Description
Project Overview: This project aims to develop a code analyzer that automatically generates comprehensive documentation for each file within a given repository. The documentation will be structured in Markdown format and will include detailed information about file relationships, dependencies, and references.
Background: The need for clear and concise code documentation is crucial for code maintainability, collaboration, and understanding. However, manually generating documentation can be time-consuming and tedious. This project aims to automate this process using advanced code analysis techniques and a powerful language model (LLM).
Project Goals:
Analyze a given repository and generate comprehensive documentation for each file.
Structure the documentation in a clear and concise Markdown format.
Include information about file relationships, dependencies, and references.
Provide insights into the code's structure and organization.
Utilize a large language model (LLM) to enhance the quality and completeness of the generated documentation.
Project Deliverables:
Code Analyzer tool with a command-line interface (CLI).
A set of well-defined LLM prompts for generating documentation.
A documented dataset of test cases for evaluation.
2. Project Objectives
SMART Objectives:
Successfully analyze a repository and generate documentation for at least 90% of the files.
Achieve a documentation accuracy rate of 95% or higher.
Generate documentation in Markdown format that adheres to a predefined structure.
Provide clear and concise documentation for all file relationships, dependencies, and references.
Integrate the LLM seamlessly for generating high-quality and insightful documentation.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
File Coverage Rate: Percentage of files successfully analyzed and documented.
Documentation Accuracy: Percentage of information in the generated documentation that is correct and complete.
Time Efficiency: Time taken to analyze and document a repository.
User Satisfaction: Feedback from users regarding the quality and usefulness of the generated documentation.
